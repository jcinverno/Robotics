# Robotics Projects Repository

## Overview:

This repository houses a collection of robotics projects developed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Java programming language. These projects encompass a wide range of applications, including autonomous navigation, machine learning for energy consumption prediction, robot modeling, teleoperation, mapping in ROS, 2D image processing with ROS and OpenCV, and complex behaviors using BehaviorTree.CPP and Nav2.

## Contents:

### Project 1: Agile Cyber-Physical Production System using MAS
Description: Develop a multiagent system using the JADE framework to control a job shop efficiently. Implement Production Agents (PA), Resource Agents (RA), and Task Agents (TA) for agile and flexible production control.

### Project 2: Machine Learning for Energy Consumption Prediction in a Manufacturing System
Description: Create a machine learning solution for predicting energy consumption during skill execution in a manufacturing system. Train regression models for each station, deploy API services, and integrate predictions into an agent-based Cyber-Physical System (CPS).

### Project 3: Robot Modelling and Kinematics
Description: Model the TR5 manipulator using URDF, implement forward and inverse kinematics in Python, and visualize the manipulator in RVIZ. Focus on accurate robot description, kinematic calculations, and control logic.

### Project 4: Teleoperation and Mapping in ROS
Description: Implement autonomous navigation in a maze using the ROS navigation stack. Use SLAM algorithms to create a map while teleoperating the robot. Achieve navigation from one end of the maze to a randomly placed GPS beacon.

### Project 5: 2D Image Processing with ROS and OpenCV
Description: Explore ROS image data representation and processing using OpenCV. Learn how to publish and subscribe image data over the ROS network. Extend ROS nodes with OpenCV for computer vision applications.

### Project 6: Complex Behaviors with BehaviorTree.CPP and Nav2
Description: Utilize the Turtlebot3 Gazebo package to adapt NavigateToPose behavior, navigating to a goal pose and spinning in place if a cone is in sight. Modify NavigateThroughPoses to navigate slowly near construction cones in the simulation scene using BehaviorTree.CPP and Nav2.
